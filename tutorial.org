* Section 1 -- start a new project
Our first step will be to start a new angular project.  For this
project we will not use angular routing and we will select SCSS as our
styling engine.  

- ng new storybook
  (do not enable angular routing)
  (select SCSS)
  Test the install by using 
  ng serve
  (navigate to localhost:4200)


Our second step is to install StoryBook.  StoryBook has a QuickStart
guide and a StorbyBook for Angular guide.  The quick start guide
advises you to use install the storybook cli and then use sb init.
Many people people have had problems with that when installing
storybook on ongoing problems.  But let's just give it a try since our
project is brand new
- npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
  we can see that sb init was able to detect we are using Angular
