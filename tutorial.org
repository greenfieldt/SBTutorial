Angular Notes -*- mode: Org -*-
#+STARTUP: showall

* Step 1 -- start a new project
Our first step will be to start a new angular project.  For this
project we will not use angular routing and we will select SCSS as our
styling engine.  

- ng new storybook
  (do not enable angular routing)
  (select SCSS)
  Test the install by using 
  ng serve
  (navigate to localhost:4200)


* Step 2 -- install Storybook
Our second step is to install StoryBook.  StoryBook has a QuickStart
guide and a StorbyBook for Angular guide.  The quick start guide
advises you to use install the storybook cli and then use sb init.
Many people people have had problems with that when installing
storybook on ongoing problems.  But let's just give it a try since our
project is brand new

(a little aside on npx -- it allows you to run commands that you don't
use very much with out install the softare)

- npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
  we can see that sb init was able to detect we are using Angular

Let's see what changed

Storybook updated Package.JSON
It added a storybook script to start storybook on port 6006
It added a bild storybook script 
It added @babel/core, babel-loader,
@storybook/[angular|addon-notes|addon-actions|addon-links|addons]

Storybook created new directory called stories and addead a default
story to it (src/stories/index.stories.ts)

Storybook modified your tsconfig.app.json and added **/*.stores.ts to
the excludes array

Storybook created a .storybook/config.js file that controls what
stories get loaded

Storybook created a .storybook/addons.js file that does something?


* Step 3 -- What's an Addon?
Addons allow you to increase the capabilities of Storybook.  One of
the most popular addons is known as Knob and it allow you to fiddle
with the state that you pass into (mainly react components).  I
haven't used that one so much but I do use the ViewPort addon so I can
be "mobile first"

- npm i --save-dev @storybook/addon-viewport

- edit .storybook/addons.js and add
  import '@storybook/addon-viewport/register';
